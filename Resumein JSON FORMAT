    "About Me":"Having Interest in Coding, used to solve
    mathematical problems along with friends from
    my college days. After graduation spent three
    years in preparing for Civil Service Examination
    but my interest being aligned towards computer
    programming I was not able to clear the exam.
    During my preparation time along with my friends
    I also did several mini projects like designing and
    verifying the results of sudoku puzzles.,. So now I
    have decided to come back to field of my interest
    completely where I could expand my knowledge
    and to utilize my potential that will enhance my
    personality and career growth. I am excited to
    start my career by joining a company composed
    of driven professionals who value creative
    problem solving.",
